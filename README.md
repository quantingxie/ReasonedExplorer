## Reasoning about the unseen for efficient outdoor object navigation

### Introduction:
In the realm of outdoor object navigation, understanding and reasoning about unseen objects is of paramount importance. This repository contains the code, datasets, and supplementary materials related to our paper.

### The Challenge:
#### Sensory challenges of deploying current methods in outdoor/real-world navigation:
- **Poor depth perception**: This makes VSLAM nearly unusable in outdoor environments.

(Add more challenges or key points as they appear in your paper.)

### Repository Structure:
- `src/`: Contains the source code of MCTS-PPT and Exploration algorithms
  - `utils/`: Utility scripts and helper functions.
- `example/`: Usecase Example
- `robot_src/`: Contains the source code to run this project on a Unitree GO1

### Getting Started:
1. **Dependencies**: (List the software dependencies and versions here.)
2. **Setup**: (Provide setup instructions.)
3. **Running Experiments**: (Provide instructions on how to run experiments or use the code.)
